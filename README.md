# libs3a
This repository contains libraries for the TAPAS framework.

Some rules for people who like to contribute:
 - Please make sure to push only sufficiently documented code to this repo !
   This means at least meaningful dicstring and full doxygen markup as best practice.
 - The repo should contain only libraries, this means functions to be used in other standalone applications.
