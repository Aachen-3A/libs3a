\subsection{Detailed Description}
\begin{DoxyVerb}sample code for logging in subprocesses using multiprocessing

* Little handler magic - The main process uses loggers and handlers as normal.
* Only a simple handler is needed in the subprocess that feeds the queue.
* Original logger name from subprocess is preserved when logged in main
  process.
* As in the other implementations, a thread reads the queue and calls the
  handlers. Except in this implementation, the thread is defined outside of a
  handler, which makes the logger definitions simpler.
* Works with multiple handlers.  If the logger in the main process defines
  multiple handlers, they will all be fed records generated by the
  subprocesses loggers.

tested with Python 2.5 and 2.6 on Linux and Windows\end{DoxyVerb}
